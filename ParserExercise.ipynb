    "# Exercise Semiring Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains coding exercises to guide you through the implementation and application of a [semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring) parser. The goal of the exercises is to understand the parsing algorithm and how information about parse trees can be encoded using the semiring abstraction. At the end of the exercise, you will be able to parse a sequence against a context-free grammar in [Chomsky normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_normal_form) and to visualize its parse forest. You can read [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J99-4004) by Joshua Goodman (1999) to learn more about semiring parsing. His [dissertation](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/24829603/tr-07-98.pdf?sequence=1). Provides even more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code in this notebook is arranged in a way that it is easy to read and that it generalizes well to real-world applications. The concrete implementation in this notebook is, however, not optimized for performance.\n",

    "for nonterminal symbols $A,B,C$ and terminal rules\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\longrightarrow a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for nonterminal symbols $A$ and terminal symbols $a$. The grammar additionally specifies one nonterminal as the start symbol and maps each rule to a value in a [semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring), a **semiring score**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we represent those binary rules by the pair of its left-hand side (lhs) and its right-hand side (rhs), `(\"A\", (\"B\", \"C\"))`, where the rhs is a pair of two nonterminal symbols. The terminal rules are represented as pairs `(\"A\", \"a\")`. One choice of the score function is the count score that maps each rule to the integer `1`. That is, the parser will calculate the number of possible parse trees of an input sequence.\n",
